# Overgreen Simulation — Critical Analysis

## Tick Pipeline

Every tick runs 7 phases in order:

```

```

## 1. ENERGY BUDGET — The Core Loop

Everything revolves around energy. A plant lives or dies by this equation:

```
  energy_change = photosynthesis - maintenance

  If surplus > 1.0:
    seedBudget = surplus × genome.seedInvestment × env.seedMult
    growthBudget = surplus × (1 - genome.seedInvestment) × env.growthMult
    energy -= seedBudget + growthBudget
```

### Photosynthesis formula:

```
  effectiveLeaf = leafArea ^ 0.7          (diminishing returns)
  heightLightBonus = height/maxH × 0.7    (trees get up to +0.7 light)
  rawEnergy = (lightLevel + heightLightBonus) × effectiveLeaf × 0.5

  rootAccess = 0.3 + 0.7 × (rootDepth / maxRoot)
  nutrientBonus = 1 + nutrients × rootAccess × 0.20

  energyProduced = rawEnergy × waterFraction × nutrientBonus
```

### Water absorption:

```
  waterNeeded = effectiveLeaf × 0.55      (transpiration demand)
  waterCanAbsorb = rootDepth × 0.4        (absorption capacity)
  waterAbsorbed = min(needed, canAbsorb, cellWater)

  waterFraction = waterAbsorbed / waterNeeded
  (0 to 1, directly scales photosynthesis)
```

### Maintenance formula:

```
  cost = 0.05                             base
       + height × 0.03                    per height
       + rootDepth × 0.03                 per root
       + effectiveLeaf × 0.04             per leaf
       + allelopathy × 0.06              chem warfare tax
       + defense × 0.05                   defense tax

  (terrain multipliers applied per-trait, see Section 5)
```

### Verdict: CRITICAL
This is the beating heart. Every other mechanic feeds into or drains from this budget.

## 2. WATER CYCLE

```
  Each tick per cell:
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  waterLevel += rechargeRate × waterMult │  (capped at 10)
  │  Drought zones: recharge reduced,       │
  │    + evaporation of 0.3/tick            │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────┘

  Base recharge rates by terrain:
  ┌──────────┬──────────┬───────────────────┐
  │ Terrain  │ Recharge │ Notes             │
  ├──────────┼──────────┼───────────────────┤
  │ Soil     │ ~0.4     │ ×(0.7-1.3) random │
  │ River    │ 1.2      │ + seepage to adj  │
  │ Rock     │ 0.08     │ no plants         │
  │ Hill     │ ~0.16    │ 0.4 × penalty     │
  │ Wetland  │ 0.7      │ starts at 80%     │
  │ Arid     │ 0.12     │ + aquifer for     │
  │          │          │   deep roots      │
  └──────────┴──────────┴───────────────────┘

  River seepage: +0.4 water, +0.1 nutrients to all 8 neighbors every tick

  Root competition: if local cell runs dry, deep-rooted plants
  drain up to 6% × (rootDepth/10) from each neighbor cell
```

### Key question: Does water ever limit growth?

On Soil at steady-state: recharge ~0.4/tick. A mature plant with leafArea=4 needs
effectiveLeaf(4^0.7=2.64) × 0.55 = 1.45 water/tick, can absorb rootDepth×0.4.
With rootDepth=3: absorbs 1.2, needs 1.45 → waterFraction ≈ 0.83. **Water matters.**

On Arid: recharge 0.12/tick. Even rootDepth=3 can only absorb min(1.2, 0.12+aquifer).
**Water is the binding constraint on Arid.** Aquifer kicks in at >40% root fraction.

On Wetland: recharge 0.7 + starts high. Water is abundant. **Rarely limiting.**

### Verdict: SIGNIFICANT
Water genuinely limits growth on Soil and especially Arid. On Wetland it's nearly free.
Root competition (draining neighbors) is weak at 6% rate — probably noise for most scenarios.

---

## 3. LIGHT & SHADOWS

```
  Base light by terrain:
  ┌──────────┬───────┐
  │ Terrain  │ Light │
  ├──────────┼───────┤
  │ Soil     │ 1.00  │
  │ Hill     │ 1.35  │  (+0.35)
  │ Wetland  │ 0.75  │  (-0.25)
  │ Arid     │ 1.20  │  (+0.20)
  └──────────┴───────┘

  Shadow from taller neighbors (8 directions):
    For each taller neighbor:
      heightDiff = neighbor.height - my.height
      shade += 0.25 × min(1, heightDiff / 3.0)

    finalLight = max(0.1, baseLight - totalShade)

  So one neighbor at +3 height = -0.25 light.
  8 tall neighbors = -2.0 light → clamped to 0.1 minimum.
```

### Height light bonus (separate from shadows):
```
  Trees:  height/10 × 0.7 = up to +0.7 at max height
  Grass:  height/2  × 0.1 = up to +0.1 at max height

  On Wetland: bonus × 1.5 (canopy emergence reward)
```

### Key question: Do shadows actually suppress small plants?

A seedling (height=0.5) next to a mature tree (height=5):
- diff = 4.5, shade = 0.25 × min(1, 4.5/3) = 0.25
- With 3 tall neighbors: light drops from 1.0 to 0.25

Meanwhile the tall tree gets +0.35 height light bonus.
**Shadows create real competitive advantage for tall plants.**

### Grass shadows:
Grass SHADOW_REDUCTION = 0.05, SHADOW_HEIGHT_SCALE = 1.0
Even max grass (height=2) only casts 0.05 shadow. **Grass barely shades anything.**

### Verdict: SIGNIFICANT for trees, NOISE for grass
Tree height creates meaningful light competition. Grass shadow is negligible.

---

## 4. NUTRIENT CYCLING

```
  Every tick:
    nutrients -= 0.02 (decay)            [era can multiply this]

  When plant dies → decomposition:
    cell.water += 2.0 (tree) or 1.0 (grass)
    cell.nutrients += 1.5 + height × 0.3 (tree)
                   or 0.8 + height × 0.1 (grass)

  Nutrient bonus to photosynthesis:
    rootAccess = 0.3 + 0.7 × rootFrac   [always at least 30% access]
    bonus = 1 + nutrients × rootAccess × 0.20

  Example: nutrients=5, full roots → bonus = 1 + 5 × 1.0 × 0.2 = 2.0 (double energy!)
  Example: nutrients=2, half roots → bonus = 1 + 2 × 0.65 × 0.2 = 1.26 (+26%)
  Example: nutrients=0, any roots → bonus = 1.0 (no effect)
```

### Nutrient caps by terrain:
```
  Soil:    10.0 (default max)
  Hill:     3.0
  Arid:     1.5
  Wetland:  8.0
  Rock:     0.5
```

### Key question: Do nutrients cycle meaningfully?

Starting nutrients are 1-4 (random). Decay at 0.02/tick = 25 ticks to lose 0.5.
Decomposition of a height-5 tree returns 1.5 + 1.5 = 3.0 nutrients.
On soil, nutrients can accumulate over many death cycles → long-term enrichment.

On Hill (cap 3.0) and Arid (cap 1.5): nutrients are scarce.
**Root-gated access means shallow-rooted plants on nutrient-rich soil still get 30% minimum.**

Hill bedrock extraction: roots > 30% depth → extract 0.15 × rootFrac × rootDepth nutrients.
This is the only way to generate nutrients on hills beyond decomposition.

### Verdict: MODERATE
Nutrients amplify energy but don't hard-gate it like water does. The 0.3 minimum access
floor means even no-root plants get some benefit. The cycling through decomposition creates
interesting long-term dynamics. Hill bedrock extraction is interesting but the 3.0 cap limits it.

---

## 5. TERRAIN SPECIALIZATION

Each terrain applies maintenance multipliers per-trait:

```
  MAINTENANCE COST MULTIPLIERS (Soil = 1.0 baseline):
  ┌──────────┬───────┬────────┬──────┐
  │ Terrain  │ Root  │ Height │ Leaf │
  ├──────────┼───────┼────────┼──────┤
  │ Soil     │ 1.0   │ 1.0    │ 1.0  │
  │ Hill     │ 3.0   │ 1.5    │ 1.0  │  ← roots 3x expensive!
  │ Wetland  │ 2.5   │ 1.0    │ 0.85 │  ← roots 2.5x, leaves cheap
  │ Arid     │ 0.8   │ 1.2    │ 3.0  │  ← leaves 3x expensive!
  └──────────┴───────┴────────┴──────┘
```

### Seed fitness weights (additive on raw genome values 0-1):

```
  TERRAIN SEED FITNESS (genome value × weight, added to base 1.0):
  ┌──────────┬───────┬────────┬──────┐
  │ Terrain  │ Root  │ Height │ Leaf │
  ├──────────┼───────┼────────┼──────┤
  │ Soil     │  0    │  0     │  0   │  (no bias)
  │ Hill     │ -0.8  │ -0.5   │ +0.3 │  ← punish root/height genes
  │ Wetland  │ -0.8  │ +0.25  │ +0.4 │  ← punish root, reward leaf
  │ Arid     │ +0.6  │ -0.4   │ -0.8 │  ← reward root, punish leaf
  └──────────┴───────┴────────┴──────┘

  fitness = 1.0 + (root×wR + height×wH + leaf×wL)
  Capped at [0, 2.0]. Multiplies seedling energy.

  Example: high-root genome (root=0.8) on Arid:
    fitness = 1.0 + 0.8×0.6 + 0.2×(-0.4) + 0.2×(-0.8)
            = 1.0 + 0.48 - 0.08 - 0.16 = 1.24  (24% bonus energy)

  Example: high-root genome (root=0.8) on Hill:
    fitness = 1.0 + 0.8×(-0.8) + 0.2×(-0.5) + 0.2×(0.3)
            = 1.0 - 0.64 - 0.10 + 0.06 = 0.32  (68% penalty!)
```

### What does each terrain "want"?

```
  Hill:     Low-root, low-height, high-leaf  (shrub strategy)
            But: height gives +0.35 light, and Hill nutrient max is only 3.0
            Tension: roots expensive + punished in seeds, but needed for nutrients

  Wetland:  Low-root, tall, leafy  (canopy emergent)
            Water abundant, height bonus ×1.5, leaves cheap maintenance
            Root maint 2.5x and seed-punished

  Arid:     Deep-root, short, small-leaf  (desert specialist)
            Water scarce, leaves 3x maint, aquifer needs deep roots
            Root maint only 0.8x (easy digging)

  Soil:     Balanced — no penalties or bonuses, neutral playing field
```

### Verdict: SIGNIFICANT
The maintenance multipliers are strong (3x!). Seed fitness creates evolutionary pressure.
But the question is: **does the sim run long enough for these pressures to actually
differentiate species?** That's what the experiments need to test.

---

## 6. GROWTH ALLOCATION & CAPS

```
  Genome has: rootPriority, heightPriority, leafSize (each 0.01-0.99)
  Normalized to fractions: rFrac + hFrac + lFrac = 1.0

  Growth caps (dynamically computed from genome!):
    maxRoot   = CAP × (0.3 + 0.7 × rFrac)
    maxHeight = CAP × (0.3 + 0.7 × hFrac)
    maxLeaf   = CAP × (0.3 + 0.7 × lFrac)

  Tree caps:   root=10, height=10, leaf=8
  Grass caps:  root=3,  height=2,  leaf=4

  Example: genome {root:0.8, height:0.1, leaf:0.1} normalized → rFrac=0.8
    maxRoot   = 10 × (0.3 + 0.7×0.8) = 10 × 0.86 = 8.6
    maxHeight = 10 × (0.3 + 0.7×0.1) = 10 × 0.37 = 3.7
    maxLeaf   = 8  × (0.3 + 0.7×0.1) = 8  × 0.37 = 2.96

  Growth per tick:
    growthBudget × fraction × 0.3 (efficiency)

  With surplus=2, growthMult=1.0:
    rootGrowth = 2 × 0.5 (non-seed) × 0.8 (rFrac) × 0.3 = 0.24/tick
    Time to reach maxRoot 8.6 from 0.5 start: ~34 ticks
```

### Key insight: Dynamic caps mean specialists get big in their niche
A root-specialist can reach rootDepth=8.6 but max height only 3.7.
A height-specialist can reach height=8.6 but max root only 3.7.
**This is the main evolutionary lever — genome priorities directly determine morphology.**

### Verdict: CRITICAL
This, combined with terrain multipliers, is where strategies diverge.

---

## 7. REPRODUCTION

```
  seedBudget = surplus × genome.seedInvestment × env.seedMult
  seedsToSpawn = floor(seedBudget / SEED_COST)

  Tree: SEED_COST=0.8, seedling gets 2.0 energy
  Grass: SEED_COST=0.4, seedling gets 1.5 energy

  Seed range = SEED_RANGE_MAX + floor(height / DIVISOR)
  Tree: 3 + height/2    (max ~8 at height 10)
  Grass: 4 + height/4   (max ~4-5)

  Must land on empty, non-river, non-rock cell.

  Sexual reproduction: finds same-species mate within radius 4
    If mate found → crossover (50/50 per gene) then mutate
    If no mate → mutate parent genome only

  Mutation: each gene ± random × 0.1 (clamped 0.01-0.99)
```

### Seed investment tradeoff:
```
  High seedInvestment (0.8): 80% of surplus to seeds, 20% to growth
    → Many seeds but plant stays small
    → Small plant = less photosynthesis = less surplus = fewer seeds long-term

  Low seedInvestment (0.2): 20% to seeds, 80% to growth
    → Plant grows big = more photosynthesis
    → But fewer seeds = slower spread

  Sweet spot should be around 0.4-0.6 depending on terrain.
```

### Verdict: SIGNIFICANT
Reproduction drives population dynamics. The seedInvestment tradeoff is real.
Grass has a massive advantage in reproduction rate (half cost, wider base range).

---

## 8. SEASONS

```
  Year = 500 ticks (4 seasons × 125 ticks each)
  Cosine interpolation between season values.

  ┌─────────┬───────┬───────┬──────────┬────────┬──────┐
  │ Season  │ Water │ Light │ LeafMaint│ Growth │ Seed │
  ├─────────┼───────┼───────┼──────────┼────────┼──────┤
  │ Spring  │ 1.20  │ 1.00  │  1.0     │ 1.30   │ 1.0  │
  │ Summer  │ 0.80  │ 1.15  │  1.0     │ 1.00   │ 1.0  │
  │ Autumn  │ 1.00  │ 0.85  │  1.0     │ 0.50   │ 0.3  │
  │ Winter  │ 0.60  │ 0.50  │  3.0     │ 0.00   │ 0.0  │
  └─────────┴───────┴───────┴──────────┴────────┴──────┘

  Energy-based leaf drop: when production < maintenance AND leafMaintenanceMult > 1.0,
  plants instantly shed leaves to 0.1. This replaces the old gradual leaf decay system.

  Winter effects:
    - Light halved → photosynthesis ~50%
    - Leaf maintenance 3x → triggers leaf drop in mid-autumn
    - Deep-rooted plants insulate (up to 80% of winter leaf penalty)
    - Growth = 0 → no size increase
    - Seeds = 0 → no reproduction
    - Plants survive on stored energy + tiny photosynthesis from 0.1 leaf area
```

### Key question: Is winter actually lethal?

Maintenance at minimum (height=1, root=1, leaf=0.25, no allelo/defense):
  0.05 + 0.03 + 0.03 + 0.04×0.25^0.7×3.0 ≈ 0.05 + 0.03 + 0.03 + 0.04 = 0.15/tick
  (with root insulation reducing the leaf penalty)

Photosynthesis at winter minimum:
  light=0.5, effectiveLeaf=0.25^0.7=0.33, heightBonus=0.07
  raw = (0.5+0.07) × 0.33 × 0.5 = 0.094
  With water and nutrients: ~0.12

**Net energy: 0.12 - 0.15 = -0.03/tick. Over 125 ticks = -3.75 energy.**
Seedlings with 2.0 starting energy die in ~65 ticks of winter.
Mature plants with 5+ energy can survive one winter.

### Verdict: SIGNIFICANT
Seasons create real selection pressure. Winter is genuinely lethal for young/weak plants.
Root insulation against leaf maintenance is a subtle but meaningful mechanic.

---

## 9. CLIMATE ERAS

```
  Long-term shifts lasting 2500-5000 ticks (5-10 years):

  ┌────────────┬───────┬───────┬──────┬───────┬─────────┬──────────┐
  │ Era        │ Water │ Light │ Grow │ Mut   │ Drought │ Fire     │
  ├────────────┼───────┼───────┼──────┼───────┼─────────┼──────────┤
  │ Temperate  │ 1.0   │ 1.0   │ 1.0  │ 1.3   │ 1.0     │ 1.0      │
  │ Arid       │ 0.65  │ 1.15  │ 1.0  │ 1.0   │ 2.5     │ 2.0      │
  │ Lush       │ 1.4   │ 0.9   │ 1.0  │ 1.0   │ 0.2     │ 0.1      │
  │ Ice Age    │ 0.85  │ 0.7   │ 0.5  │ 0.7   │ 0.5     │ 0.3      │
  │ Volatile   │ 1.0   │ 1.0   │ 1.0  │ 1.5   │ 2.0     │ 2.5      │
  │ Fertile    │ 1.3   │ 1.1   │ 1.3  │ 1.0   │ 0.2     │ 0.1      │
  └────────────┴───────┴───────┴──────┴───────┴─────────┴──────────┘

  Era selection biased by population:
    <200 plants → favors Fertile/Temperate (recovery)
    >800 plants → favors Volatile/Arid (culling)
    >50% monoculture → favors Lush (disease punishes uniformity)

  Harsh eras (Arid, IceAge, Volatile) never follow each other.
  200-tick cosine transition between eras.
```

### Verdict: MODERATE
Eras multiply existing mechanics. They don't introduce new dynamics, they amplify
or suppress existing ones. The population-responsive selection is interesting for
preventing total extinction or runaway growth.

---

## 10. DISASTERS

### Drought:
```
  Summer only. Radius 8-20, duration 30-70 ticks, intensity 0.6-0.95.
  Effect: reduce water recharge + evaporate 0.3/tick in affected area.
  Impact: local water crisis → plants dependent on stored water or deep roots.
```

### Fire:
```
  Summer only (after 30% progress). Starts on cell with plant + low water (<2.0).
  Spread: 35% base × (1 - waterResist×0.7) × (0.4 + leafFuel×0.6)
  Duration: 8-16 ticks. Burns 3-5 ticks per cell.
  Kills plants instantly, +2 nutrients, -1.5 water.
  Rivers block fire spread.
```

### Disease (Blight):
```
  Not in winter. After tick 300. Requires genetic uniformity >50% in radius 5.
  Targets genetically similar plants (distance < 0.25).
  Spread: 30% × susceptibility² per tick.
  Effect: -0.15 energy/tick + 30% photosynthesis penalty.
  Duration: 40-80 ticks overall, 15-25 ticks per cell.

  This is the monoculture punisher — diverse populations are resistant.
```

### Verdict: MODERATE (individually), SIGNIFICANT (collectively)
Each disaster is localized and temporary. But they create selection pressure over time:
- Drought rewards deep roots
- Fire rewards high water areas and small leaf area
- Disease rewards genetic diversity

---

## 11. ALLELOPATHY (Chemical Warfare)

```
  If genome.allelopathy > 0.1:
    strength = allelopathy × (0.5 + 0.5 × rootDepth/10)
    damage = strength × 0.15 per neighbor per tick

  Cost: allelopathy × 0.06 maintenance per tick

  Example: allelopathy=0.8, rootDepth=5:
    strength = 0.8 × (0.5 + 0.25) = 0.6
    damage = 0.6 × 0.15 = 0.09 per neighbor per tick
    cost = 0.8 × 0.06 = 0.048 per tick

  With 4 neighbors: total damage dealt = 0.36, personal cost = 0.048
  ROI: 7.5x damage-to-cost ratio. BUT only useful if neighbors exist.
```

### Key question: Is allelopathy OP or useless?

In dense forests: 4+ neighbors → dealing 0.36 total damage for 0.048 cost = very strong.
In sparse areas: 0-1 neighbors → paying 0.048 for 0-0.09 damage = net loss.

**Allelopathy is situationally powerful but self-defeating: it kills neighbors,
which then removes the benefit, leaving only the maintenance cost.**

### Verdict: UNCERTAIN — needs testing
Theory says it should be useful in dense competition then decline. But does the
sim actually produce scenarios where this matters? Need experiment.

---

## 12. DEFENSE (Anti-Herbivore)

```
  Reduces grazing by: defense × 0.7 (70% at max defense)
  Damages herbivore: defense × 0.3 energy per graze
  Minimum leaf after graze: 0.2 × defense (protected reserve)
  Also reduces trample damage by (1 - defense)

  Cost: defense × 0.05 maintenance per tick

  But herbivores don't spawn until tick 200, start with only 12,
  and are capped at 150 population.
```

### Key question: Is the defense tax worth it?

Without herbivores (first 200 ticks): pure waste at 0.05×defense per tick.
With herbivores: depends on herbivore density.
If herbivores are rare: barely matters, you're paying tax for nothing.
If herbivores are swarming: saves your leaves = saves your photosynthesis.

**The problem: defense costs are constant, herbivore pressure is intermittent.**

### Verdict: UNCERTAIN — needs testing
Depends entirely on herbivore population dynamics. If herbivores stay low,
defense is pure noise. If they boom, it becomes critical.

## 13. GRASS vs TREE ARCHETYPE

  Grass strategy: cheap, fast-breeding, short-lived, many seeds
  Tree strategy: expensive, tall, long-lived, shade competitors
```

### Competition dynamics:
- Trees shade grass (0.25 per tall neighbor)
- Grass barely shades trees (0.05)
- Grass reproduces 2x cheaper → colonizes empty space faster
- Trees live 2.5x longer → hold territory once established

**Expected: grass colonizes first, trees gradually displace through shading.**

### Verdict: SIGNIFICANT
The two archetypes create fundamentally different strategies.

## MECHANICS RANKED BY IMPACT

```
  CRITICAL (drives everything):
    1. Energy budget (photosynthesis vs maintenance)
    2. Growth allocation / genome priorities
    3. Water absorption & limitation

  SIGNIFICANT (meaningfully affects outcomes):
    4. Terrain maintenance multipliers
    5. Light & shadow competition (trees only)
    6. Seasons (especially winter lethality)
    7. Reproduction / seedInvestment tradeoff
    8. Grass vs tree archetype differences
    9. Terrain seed fitness (evolutionary pressure)

  MODERATE (amplifies other mechanics):
   10. Nutrient cycling
   11. Climate eras
   12. Disasters (drought, fire, disease)

  UNCERTAIN (may be noise):
   13. Allelopathy — powerful in theory, self-defeating in practice?
   14. Defense — depends on herbivore pressure
   15. Root competition — 6% drain rate seems too weak
   16. Hill bedrock nutrient extraction — narrow niche
   17. Arid aquifer access — important on Arid, irrelevant elsewhere

## EXPERIMENT RESULTS

### Experiment 1: Monoculture Baseline
**Goal:** Can a single balanced grass species sustain itself on flat soil?
**Result:** NO — all grass dies in winter.

**Root cause:** Gradual leaf decay (0.01-0.03/tick) too slow. Plants bleed energy paying 3x leaf maintenance on slowly-shrinking leaves for 50+ ticks. Isolated plant survives with 0.096 energy margin, but any neighbor root competition (~3.8% water drain) pushes it over the edge. Also GRASS.MAX_AGE=200 means grass can't live through one 500-tick year.

**Fixes applied:**
1. Replaced gradual leaf decay with energy-based leaf drop — plants instantly shed leaves to 0.1 when losing energy and leafMaintenanceMult > 1.0
2. GRASS.MAX_AGE: 200 → 750 (1.5 years)
3. SIM.MAX_AGE (trees): 500 → 2500 (5 years)

**Verified:** Re-ran with 4 grass species varying leaf/root. All survived winter. Healthy seasonal cycle, population oscillating ~1100-3100.

### Experiment 2: Water Competition
**Goal:** Does deep roots or big leaves win when two tree species compete on flat soil?
**Result:** Near-perfect coexistence — Broad Leaf 53%, Deep Root 47%. Shannon diversity stable at 0.69.

Cross-species interaction confirmed (68-70% x_spp% at peak). Deep Root leads early (187 vs 130 at tick 275) when water matters most — occupied cell water drops to 0.4-1.5. But Broad Leaf overtakes mid-year 2 via shading (49-66% shaded at peak). By year 3 they're nearly equal again (221 vs 203). Deep Root evolves toward Broad Leaf's strategy (root 0.50→0.42, height 0.26→0.43, leaf 0.25→0.44) — convergent evolution on flat soil where no terrain pressure maintains specialization.

**Conclusion:** Leaf/shading slightly stronger than root/water on flat soil, but both viable. No sim changes needed.

### Experiment 3: Light Competition
**Goal:** Does growing tall (shading others) or spreading leaves (more photosynthesis) win?
**Result:** Tall wins but doesn't eliminate short-leafy. Healthy coexistence at 64/36% split.

Cross-species interaction confirmed: 73-74% of plants had a different-species neighbor at peak density. At high density (shading 40-65%), Tall Pine's height advantage suppresses Spread Fern's light. But at low density (winter/spring, shading <10%), Spread Fern's extra leaf area produces more raw energy. Both strategies remain viable across 4 years.

Interesting evolution: both species drifted toward higher seed investment (0.50 → 0.56-0.60) and higher roots (0.25 → 0.35-0.41). Spread Fern's height crept from 0.23 → 0.29 (adapting to compete). Allelopathy drifting up naturally in both (0.02 → 0.10-0.12).

Shannon diversity stable at 0.65 (vs 0.69 start). No extinction risk.

**Conclusion:** Height gives a real but not overwhelming competitive edge on flat soil. Both tall canopy and short leafy strategies coexist — matches real forest structure. No sim changes needed.

### Experiment 4: Seed Tradeoff
**Goal:** What's the optimal seed investment? Low (0.3) vs mid (0.5) vs high (0.7), identical base genomes.
**Result:** Mid wins (75%), High second (25%), Low nearly extinct (<1%).

Both Mid and High evolved toward seedInvestment ~0.68, converging from opposite directions. This is the apparent optimum on flat soil. Low Seed Oak survived as 2-3 plants the entire run — individually healthy (highest energy) but unable to reproduce fast enough. seedInvestment=0.3 is a death sentence.

Mid beats High because slightly bigger plants before seeding produce more competitive offspring. High floods with weaker seedlings. Both are viable but moderate investment has the edge.

**Conclusion:** Optimal seed investment ~0.68 on flat soil. Too little reproduction is fatal regardless of individual fitness. No sim changes needed.

### Experiment 5: Allelopathy Duel
**Goal:** Does chemical warfare (allelopathy 0.5) justify its maintenance cost against a passive competitor?
**Result:** Toxic Walnut wins 67/33%, but through spatial exclusion, not ongoing warfare.

Cross-species contact started at 84% then collapsed to 0% by tick 850. Allelopathy caused massive early deaths (96-151 per snapshot during mixing) which pushed Peaceful Maple out of shared territory. After segregation, Toxic Walnut holds more space but pays 0.03/tick maintenance for zero benefit. Its allelopathy is evolving downward (0.51 → 0.40) — selection pressure against wasted maintenance.

**Conclusion:** Allelopathy is an effective territorial weapon but self-defeating — it eliminates the neighbors it's designed to fight. Realistic (real walnut trees create exclusion zones). No sim changes needed.

### Experiment 6: Defense vs Herbivores
**Goal:** Does defense (0.5) justify its maintenance cost against herbivore grazing?
**Result:** No — Soft Willow (undefended) wins 56/44%. Defense is a net negative.

Defense costs 0.025/tick permanent maintenance but only 12 herbivores roam 6400 cells with hundreds-to-thousands of plants. Any given plant gets grazed rarely, so the permanent tax outweighs occasional protection. Thorny Holly's defense evolving down (0.48 → 0.40), Soft Willow's creeping up (0.01 → 0.16) — converging as usual.

**Conclusion:** Defense is correctly modeled but herbivore pressure is too dilute for it to matter. Not a bug — defense would become valuable at higher herbivore density. No sim changes needed.

### Experiment 7: Hill Specialist
**Goal:** Do terrain pressures enforce specialization? Root/height/leaf specialists on pure hills.
**Result:** Tall Spruce (height 0.6) dominates at 81%, Deep Root Pine (root 0.6) survives at 19%, Broad Leaf Holly (leaf 0.6) extinct by tick 900.

Prediction was leaf would win (hills: +0.3 seed fitness, 1.0x leaf maint). Instead height won because hills are water-scarce (0.4x recharge) — big leaves need water to photosynthesize, making them a liability. Height's shading advantage (+0.35 hill light bonus amplifies tall plants' competitive edge) compounds over time. This matches real nature: conifers (tall, small leaves) dominate hillsides over broadleaf species.

Deep Root Pine persisted via water access (roots drifted 0.57→0.66) but couldn't overcome 3x root maintenance cost. Both surviving species converged: Spruce gained roots (0.20→0.49), Pine gained height (0.19→0.37).

**Conclusion:** Hill terrain working well. Terrain pressure successfully enforces differentiation from flat-soil outcomes. No sim changes needed.

### Experiment 8: Arid Specialist
**Goal:** Do arid terrain pressures enforce root specialization?
**Tuning required:** Original arid settings (0.12 water recharge, 0.4 aquifer threshold) caused total extinction — chicken-and-egg problem where plants needed water to grow roots but needed roots to access water. Fixed by lowering aquifer threshold 0.4→0.25 (desert soils have shallow water tables) and bumping recharge 0.12→0.2 (fog/dew moisture).
**Result:** Deep Root Mesquite wins 100%. Broad Leaf Agave and Tall Saguaro both extinct.

Near-extinction bottleneck (2 plants at tick 1075) but recovered. Mesquite maintained root dominance (0.59→0.65) while gaining moderate height/leaf — terrain pressure enforced specialization. Leaf specialist actually outlasted height specialist (3x leaf maintenance is harsh but height offers no advantage without competition). Water stress dropped to 0-7% once aquifer-accessing population established.

**Conclusion:** Arid terrain now working correctly after tuning. Matches real desert ecology — deep-rooted species (mesquite, acacia) dominate.
